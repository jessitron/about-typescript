# explore-deps

Pretend your npm package is a dungeon, and all its dependencies are rooms. Explore them.

## installation

`npm install -g @jessitron/explore-deps`

## usage

Go to any directory that contains an npm module (it needs a valid package.json) and run `explore`. See if you can figure out the victory condition :-)

This is tested in a black-background terminal window. No guarantees on the colors outside of that.

## contributing

You could, but wouldn't it be more fun to fork this and make your own?
